## Fast Markov Random Field Language Models

[Documentation in progress]

A Torch implementation of a fast variational inference algorithm for Markov
Random Field language models as well as other Markov sequence models.

This algorithm implemented in this project is described in the paper

    A Fast Variational Approach for Learning Markov Random Field Language Models
